sdesc: "Xiph low-delay audio codec (libdevel)"
ldesc: "CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality 
communications. Its potential uses include video-conferencing and 
network music performance. The code is still in early stage, so it may 
be broken from time to time and the bit-stream is not frozen yet."
